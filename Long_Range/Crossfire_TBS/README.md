# Protocol Crossfire (CRSF) with OpenAVRc

## Crossfire TBS
The [TBS CROSSFIRE](https://www.team-blacksheep.com/products/prod:crossfire_tx) is a long range R/C link based on the newest RF technology,  
capable of self-healing two-way communications and range beyond comprehension.  
With a sensitivity of -130dB, full RF-side diveristy, tiny receivers for FPV quads,  
the TBS CROSSFIRE contains the most modern technology to provide a superior long range control link. 

## Telemetry / CRSF
As a modern R/C link, it has telemetry built in.  
Two-way communication opens up new possibilities.  
From streaming MAVLink to you smart device, to updating your firmware,  
setting your video transmitter channel or adjusting flight control parameters such as PIDs.  
Adaptive bandwidth controls the speed of transmission or optimizes for ultimate range.  
CRSF is a proprietary TBS communication protocol between the Crossfire and R/C and Flight Control.  
It provides ultra-low latency with incredible bandwidth (3x faster, 6x more data than any comparable protocol!).  
With such tight integration, the TBS Crossfire is the logical choice for anyone flying Betaflight, KiSS or ArduPilot/Pixhawk platforms.
