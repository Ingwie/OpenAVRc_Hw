### The Legal Stuff ###

# The use and operation of this type of device may require a license and some countries may forbid its use entirely.
# It is entirely up to the end user to ensure compliance with local regulations. No claim of regulatory compliance is made. In most cases a HAM license is required.
# This is experimental software/hardware and there is no guarantee of stability or reliability. USE AT YOUR OWN RISK

### BINDING PHRASE: ###
# Uncomment the line below to use a hardcoded binding phrase
# Leave commented to use traditional binding

### REGULATORY DOMAIN: ###

# Domain is used to define correct frequency band for 900MHz hardware.

# For TX devices with fans, FAN_MIN_RUNTIME keeps the fan running even after the power level has
# dropped below the configured Fan Threshold. This prevents the fan from turning on and off every
# few seconds if the power level is constantly changing.
# Default is 30 seconds if not defined, value can be 0-254.

### COMPATIBILITY OPTIONS: ###

# Invert the TX/RX half-duplex pin in the transmitter code. Handset external
# modules are almost all inverted. ESP32 targets only
#-DUART_INVERTED

# Use a custom baud rate on the receiver for a KISS v1 FC (which runs at 400000) or any other oddball baud
# If not defined, will default to 420000
#-DRCVR_UART_BAUD=400000

# Invert the TX pin in the receiver code to allow an inverted RX pin on the
# FC to be used (usually labeled SBUS input or RXI). Inverted CRSF output.
# RX pin (telemetry) is unaffected. Update via_BetaflightPassthrough will
# not work, only via_Wifi. ESP8266/8285 targets only
-DRCVR_INVERT_TX

# Use the SBUS **pin** on R9MM receiver hardware, which is inverted.
# Does not output SBUS protocol, just inverted CRSF.

### Debugging options ###

# Turn on debug messages, if disabled then all debugging options (starting with DEBUG_) are disabled
#-DDEBUG_LOG
# Use DEBUG_LOG_VERBOSE instead (or both) to see verbose debug logging (spammy stuff)
#-DDEBUG_LOG_VERBOSE

# Print a letter for each packet received or missed (RX debugging)

# Don't send RC msgs over UART

#
# Activate one or the 2 define below if you want that ELRS change Hybrid and/or Wide mode 
# to send 8 channels in high resolution + 2 channels in low resolution (5 bit = 32 positions)
# The 8 channels are channels 1 up to 4 and 6 up to 9
# The 2 channels are channels 10 and 11
# Note : Channel 5 is also sent as AUX1 (as ON/OFF)
-DUSE_HYBRID_MODE_FOR_10_CHANNELS
-DUSE_HYBRIDWIDE_MODE_FOR_10_CHANNELS

# Activate the option below if you want that ELRS Rx generates SBUS frames instead of CRSF frame on the Tx pin
# When activate, the baudrate on TX and RX pins is changed to 100000 baud (standard SBUS baud)
# Please note that the signal is a normal UART signal and not an inverted one like official SBUS.
# It means that if you want to connect it to a standard SBUS/PWM converter you have to insert an inverter in between
# in current version, the failsafe bits of SBUS are not managed (failsafe uses only a HOLD mode)
