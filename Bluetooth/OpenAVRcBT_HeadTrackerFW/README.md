# OpenAVRc_Head-Tracker

This **Head tracker** code is a fork of the Project father: [Denis Frie](https://github.com/kniuk/DIY-Head-Tracker).

The **HeadTrackerGUI.exe** software is usable also with an Arduino Pro Micro.

We have added a compatibility with the **OpenAVRc** Bluetooth v2.0 mode (not v4.0 BLE mode).
