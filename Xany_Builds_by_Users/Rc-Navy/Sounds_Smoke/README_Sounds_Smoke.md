# Sounds and Smoke module

## PRESENTATION

There are different Diesel noisemakers and different smoke generators for RC models.  
    For Diesel noisemakers, only those using audio recordings of real engines produce a sound very close to real engines.  
    For smoke generators, only those based on a piezo atomizer produce smoke (white) free of fatty deposits: it is only vaporized water.  
Based on this observation, I came up with the idea of ​​designing a Sound and Smoke Module that combines the 2 functions. The smoke produced will obviously be proportional to the engine gases.  
In parallel with the engine noise, additional sounds can be played (eg seagull cry, fog horn, waterway alarm, or other).
